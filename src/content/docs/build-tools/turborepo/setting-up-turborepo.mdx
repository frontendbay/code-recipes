Turborepo can be installed both globally and in your repository. It is highly recommend installing it both ways so you can take advantage of fast, convenient workflows and a stable version of turbo for all developers working in your repository.

## Procedure

<Steps>

1. Install `turbo` globally

    ```bash frame="terminal" showLineNumbers=false
    pnpm install turbo --global
    ```
    
    Once installed globally, you can run your scripts through `turbo` from your terminal, quickly running one-off commands to use within your repository. For example:
   
   | Command | Usage |
   |:----|:----|
   |`turbo build` | Run build scripts following your repository's dependency graph |
   |`turbo build` <br/> `--filter=docs` `--dry` | Quickly print an outline of the build task for your docs package (without running it) |
   |`turbo generate` | Run Generators to add new code to your repository |
   |`cd apps/docs`  `&&` `turbo build` | Run the build script in the docs package and its dependencies |

2. Create Turborepo root workspace with the following command:

    ```bash frame="terminal" showLineNumbers=false
    pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
    ```
