Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allows developers to extract component logic into reusable functions. By leveraging the composability of hooks, you can create cleaner, more modular code and share behavior across multiple components without the need for complex patterns like higher-order components or render props.

This documentation explores the commonly used custom hooks, their benefits, and best practices for creating and using them effectively in your React applications.
