React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They enable developers to reuse stateful logic between components, making code more readable, maintainable, and easier to test. Hooks solve many problems that developers faced with class components, such as the complexity of sharing non-visual logic between components and the confusion around the 'this' keyword in JavaScript classes.

## Commonly used hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `useState`  | For adding state to functional components |
| `useEffect` | For handling side effects in components |
| `useContext` | For consuming context in a more straightforward way |
| `useRef` | For creating mutable references that persist across re-renders |
| `useMemo` | For optimizing performance by memoizing values |
| `useCallback` | For optimizing performance by memoizing callbacks |

## `useState`

`useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

### Code example 
This is a simple React component called Counter using the useState hook to manage a count state variable, initially set to 0. The component renders the current count value and a button. When the button is clicked, it increments the count by 1 using the setCount function. 

This creates a basic interactive counter that updates and displays its value in real-time as the user clicks the button.
```jsx  title="src/pages/index.astro"
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## `useEffect` 

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

```jsx
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

### Code example 
This example defines a React functional component called DataFetcher. It uses the useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and side effects.
The component fetches data from an API when it mounts, using an asynchronous function inside useEffect. While the data is being fetched, it displays "Loading...". 

Once the data is retrieved, it updates the state and renders the fetched data. The empty dependency array in `useEffect` ensures the fetch operation only occurs once when the component mounts.
```jsx
const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once on mount

  return <div>{data ? <p>{data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}</div>;
};
```

## `useContext` 

`useContext` is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

```jsx
const value = useContext(SomeContext)
```

### Code example 
This code demonstrates the use of React's Context API to manage and share a theme across components. It defines a `ThemeContext` with a default value of 'light', then creates a `ThemedButton` component that consumes this context. The button's background color is dynamically set based on the current theme value, switching between white for the light theme and black for the dark theme. 

This approach allows for easy theme propagation throughout an application without prop drilling, making it simpler to implement and manage theming in larger React projects.
```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

const ThemedButton = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#000' }}>
        I'm a themed button
    </button>
  )
};
```

## `useRef` 

`useRef` is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
```

### Code example 
This code defines a React functional component called `FocusInput`. It creates an input field and a button. The component uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the input element. When the button is clicked, it calls the `focusInput` function, which uses the reference to programmatically set focus on the input field. 

This allows users to easily bring focus to the input element by clicking the button, enhancing the user experience and accessibility of the component.

```jsx
const FocusInput = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## `useMemo` 

`useMemo` is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

```jsx
const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)
```

### Code example 
This code defines a React functional component called `ExpensiveCalculation` that takes a prop `num` as input. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize an expensive calculation, which in this case is simply cubing the input number. The `useMemo` hook ensures that the calculation is only performed when the `num` prop changes, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations. 

The component logs "Calculating..." to the console when the calculation is performed, and then renders the result within a div element. This approach is particularly useful for computationally intensive operations in React applications, as it helps prevent redundant calculations and improves overall efficiency.

```jsx
const ExpensiveCalculation = ({ num }) => {
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating...');
    return num * num * num;
  }, [num]); // Only recalculate if 'num' changes

  return <div>Result: {expensiveResult}</div>;
};
```

## `useCallback`

`useCallback` is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

```jsx
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)
```

### Code example 
This code defines a React component structure with a parent-child relationship, demonstrating the use of hooks and performance optimization techniques. The `ParentComponent` manages a count state using `useState` and defines an `incrementCount` function with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. It renders a `ChildComponent`, passing the increment function as a prop, along with displaying the current count. The `ChildComponent` is wrapped in `React.memo` for performance optimization and renders a button that triggers the increment function when clicked. 

This setup ensures that the `ChildComponent` only re-renders when its props change, not on every re-render of the parent, potentially improving the application's performance.

```jsx
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // This callback doesn't depend on any values, so it never changes

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent onIncrement={incrementCount} />
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onIncrement }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>;
});
```
