Dynamic theme switching allows users to change the visual appearance of your application on-the-fly. This recipe demonstrates how to implement this feature in a React application using Tailwind CSS for styling.

:::note
This recipe builds upon the [Support Multiple Themes](/design-engineering/tailwind/support-multiple-themes) configuration. Please review that guide first to understand how to set up multiple theme support in Tailwind CSS.

## Steps to Create Switch

<Steps>

1. Define a utility function called `changeTheme` that applies a theme to the HTML element:

    ```ts
    // src/utils/helper.ts
    export const changeTheme = (theme: string) => {
      document.querySelector("html")?.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
    };
    ```
    
    This function takes a `theme` string as an argument and sets it as a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element. Tailwind CSS will use this attribute to apply the corresponding theme styles.

2. Inside your component, create buttons (or any other user intercatable element) that, when intercated with, call the `changeTheme` function with the corresponding theme name:

    ```jsx {10,15,20}
    // src/pages/index.tsx
    import { changeTheme } from "@/utils/helper";
    export default function Home() {

    return (
      <div className='h-screen grid place-items-center bg-primary'>
        <div>
          <button
            className='py-2 px-8 bg-buttons text-typography m-2'
            onClick={() => changeTheme("")}>
            Default
          </button>
          <button
            className='py-2 px-8 bg-buttons text-typography m-2'
            onClick={() => changeTheme("uno")}>
              Theme Uno
          </button>
          <button
            className='py-2 px-8 bg-buttons text-typography m-2'
            onClick={() => changeTheme("dos")}>
              Theme Dos
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    )}
    ```

    This is an example component that renders three buttons, each corresponding to a different theme. When clicked, they call the `changeTheme` function with the appropriate theme name.
</Steps>

## Additional Considerations

- **Persistence**: To maintain the user's theme preference across sessions, consider storing the selected theme in `localStorage` and applying it on initial page load.

- **System Preference**: You may want to respect the user's system-wide dark/light mode preference initially. Use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect this and set an appropriate default theme.

- **Accessibility**: Ensure that your theme colors maintain sufficient contrast ratios for readability across all themes.

- **Performance**: If your themes involve many style changes, consider using CSS variables for smoother transitions and better performance.
